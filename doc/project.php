It's a platform game strongly inspired by the BBC Micro game, Citadel.  (I have another project dedicated to mapping <a href=\"http://aidansean.com/projects/?p=141\">Citadel</a>.)  When I was younger I would dream about playing non-existant extra levels in Citadel, and when I started recreational programming I would sometimes dream about making new levels for the game.", "Games", "canvas,CSS,HTML,JavaScript") ;
